### Hands-On Tutorial for `bc`

The `bc` command is an arbitrary precision calculator language, which allows you to perform mathematical operations directly from the command line.

**Basic Usage:**
```sh
bc [options]
```

#### Examples:

1. **Basic Calculations:**
   ```sh
   echo "5 + 3" | bc
   ```
   This will output `8`.

2. **Using Variables:**
   ```sh
   echo "a=5; b=3; a*b" | bc
   ```
   This will output `15`.

3. **Advanced Calculations with Scale:**
   ```sh
   echo "scale=2; 10/3" | bc
   ```
   This sets the number of decimal places to 2, outputting `3.33`.

4. **Using `bc` Interactively:**
   ```sh
   bc
   ```
   Enter into interactive mode where you can type calculations directly.

### Hands-On Tutorial for `tcpdump`

The `tcpdump` command is a network packet analyzer. It allows you to capture and display packets being transmitted or received over a network.

**Basic Usage:**
```sh
tcpdump [options]
```

#### Examples:

1. **Capture Packets on Default Interface:**
   ```sh
   sudo tcpdump
   ```
   This will capture packets on the default network interface.

2. **Capture Packets on a Specific Interface:**
   ```sh
   sudo tcpdump -i eth0
   ```
   This captures packets on the `eth0` interface.

3. **Write Capture to a File:**
   ```sh
   sudo tcpdump -w capture.pcap
   ```
   This writes the captured packets to `capture.pcap`.

4. **Read Packets from a File:**
   ```sh
   tcpdump -r capture.pcap
   ```
   This reads packets from the file `capture.pcap`.

5. **Capture Only HTTP Traffic:**
   ```sh
   sudo tcpdump tcp port 80
   ```
   This captures only HTTP traffic (port 80).

### Hands-On Tutorial for `wireshark`

Wireshark is a GUI-based network protocol analyzer. It lets you capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network.

**Installation:**

- **On Linux:**
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install wireshark
  ```
- **On macOS:**
  ```sh
  brew install wireshark
  ```

#### Examples:

1. **Starting Wireshark:**
   - Open Wireshark from your application menu, or by typing `wireshark` in your terminal.

2. **Capturing Packets:**
   - Select the network interface to capture from the list provided.
   - Click the shark fin icon (start capturing packets).

3. **Filtering Packets:**
   - Use the filter bar at the top to filter packets. For example, to filter HTTP traffic, type `http`.

4. **Saving Captures:**
   - After capturing, go to `File > Save As` to save the captured packets to a file.

5. **Analyzing Packets:**
   - Click on any packet to view its details in the lower pane.
   - Expand different sections to see more information about each packet.

### Conclusion

By following these tutorials, you will gain proficiency in performing mathematical operations, capturing network packets, and analyzing network traffic using `bc`, `tcpdump`, and Wireshark. Experiment with each tool to become more comfortable with their features and capabilities.

### In-Depth Tutorial for `tcpdump`

`tcpdump` is a powerful command-line packet analyzer. It allows users to capture and analyze network traffic. This tutorial will cover basic usage, filters, advanced options, and practical examples.

#### 1. **Installation**

- **On Debian/Ubuntu:**
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install tcpdump
  ```
- **On Red Hat/CentOS:**
  ```sh
  sudo yum install tcpdump
  ```
- **On macOS:**
  ```sh
  brew install tcpdump
  ```

#### 2. **Basic Usage**

**Capture Packets on Default Interface:**
```sh
sudo tcpdump
```
**Expected Output:**
```
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
11:45:01.234567 IP 192.168.1.2.12345 > 192.168.1.1.http: Flags [S], seq 0, win 29200, options [mss 1460,sackOK,TS val 4294967295 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7], length 0
11:45:01.234890 IP 192.168.1.1.http > 192.168.1.2.12345: Flags [S.], seq 0, ack 1, win 29200, options [mss 1460,sackOK,TS val 4294967295 ecr 4294967295,nop,wscale 7], length 0
```
**Discussion:**
This output shows packets captured on the default interface (`eth0` in this case). Each line represents a packet with details like timestamp, source and destination IP addresses, ports, flags, sequence numbers, and other options. The first packet is a SYN packet (Flags [S]), part of the TCP handshake, and the second packet is a SYN-ACK packet (Flags [S.]), responding to the SYN.

**Capture Packets on a Specific Interface:**
```sh
sudo tcpdump -i eth0
```
**Expected Output:**
```
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
11:46:01.234567 IP 192.168.1.2.12345 > 192.168.1.1.http: Flags [S], seq 0, win 29200, options [mss 1460,sackOK,TS val 4294967295 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7], length 0
```
**Discussion:**
This output is similar to the previous one but explicitly captures packets on the `eth0` interface. It shows packets being transmitted from `192.168.1.2` to `192.168.1.1` over port `http` (port 80).

**Capture Only a Specific Number of Packets:**
```sh
sudo tcpdump -c 10
```
**Expected Output:**
```
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
11:47:01.234567 IP 192.168.1.2.12345 > 192.168.1.1.http: Flags [S], seq 0, win 29200, options [mss 1460,sackOK,TS val 4294967295 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7], length 0
10 packets captured
10 packets received by filter
0 packets dropped by kernel
```
**Discussion:**
This output captures only 10 packets before stopping. The summary at the end shows the number of packets captured, filtered, and dropped. This is useful for limiting the amount of data collected, especially in high-traffic environments.

**Write Capture to a File:**
```sh
sudo tcpdump -w capture.pcap
```
**Expected Output:**
```
tcpdump: listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
```
**Discussion:**
This command writes the captured packets to a file named `capture.pcap`. The output shows that tcpdump is actively capturing packets on the specified interface. This file can be analyzed later using tools like Wireshark.

**Read Packets from a File:**
```sh
tcpdump -r capture.pcap
```
**Expected Output:**
```
reading from file capture.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
11:45:01.234567 IP 192.168.1.2.12345 > 192.168.1.1.http: Flags [S], seq 0, win 29200, options [mss 1460,sackOK,TS val 4294967295 ecr 0,nop,wscale 7], length 0
```
**Discussion:**
This command reads packets from the previously saved `capture.pcap` file and displays them in a similar format to live captures. This is useful for offline analysis of network traffic.

#### 3. **Filters**

**Capture Only TCP Packets:**
```sh
sudo tcpdump tcp
```
**Expected Output:**
